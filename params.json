{"name":"Hebcal","tagline":"A perpetual Jewish Calendar","body":"### What is it?\r\nHebcal is a perpetual Jewish calendar program, implemented in C. The key routines are translations of Dershowitz & Reingold's lisp code in GNU-Emacs 18. Hebcal offers several convenience routines that make it a good fit for generating calendars for PDAs and personal calendars.\r\n\r\nHebcal has been successfully ported to Perl, C, and Javascript, but I'm currently only maintaining the C implementation.\r\n\r\n### GitHub now hosts new development\r\nWe're using sourceforge for further development on hebcal. Go to the [hebcal project page](https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal) to report a bug, get the latest release, or browse the source.\r\n\r\n### [References](references.html)\r\n### [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.html)\r\n### [Web Sites Offering access to hebcal data](websites.html)\r\nHebcal is made available for free under the [Gnu Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html).
